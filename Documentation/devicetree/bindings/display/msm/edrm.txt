Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. EDRM KMS

EDRM KMS implements Linux DRM/KMS APIs to drive early user interface to
different panel interfaces. EDRM driver provides early service to display
subsystem which manage a subset data paths to specific panel interfaces.
EDRM is expected to provide display service to fill in the gap between
bootloader and main application UI.  Only early application is expected to
use EDRM.  EDRM will be terminated when main application UI is ready.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-kms-edrm"

Assigned Display Subnodes:
- qcom,edrm-assigned-display:	List of display that eDRM can use.

Subnode properties:
- qcom,edrm-display-id@x:	a node that contains the display information

- qcom,label:	The string that indicate the label of the display.  The
			label should match with the label used in sde_display.
			For example, SDE display dtsi may defined:
				dsi_adv_7533_2: qcom,dsi-display@8 {...}

			If eDRM wants to use that display, it should set the
			label as:
				qcom,label = "dsi_adv_7533_1";

- qcom,intf-type:  a string that indicate the interface type.  Right now
				it can be "dsi" or "hdmi"

- qcom,assigned_plane :	List of plane that assigned for this display.
				There must be at least one plane in this field.
				The plane that is in this field must also be
				defined in qcom,sde-reserved-plane under sde_kms
				For example, SDE may contains the following
				reserved plane:
				&sde_kms {
					qcom,sde-reserved-plane {
					reserved_plane1: qcom,sde-reserved-plane@1 {
					reg = <0x1>;
					qcom,plane-name = "rgb3";
					lm-stage = <5>;
				}
				Then assigned_plane field can reference to the
				reserved plane like:
				qcom,assigned_plane = <&reserved_plane1>;

Example:
	msm_kms_edrm: qcom,msm_kms_edrm@900000 {
		qcom,edrm-assigned-display {
			qcom,edrm-display-id@0 {
				qcom,label = "dsi_adv_7533_1";
				qcom,intf-type = "dsi";
				qcom,assigned_plane = <&reserved_plane1>;
			}
		}
	}
