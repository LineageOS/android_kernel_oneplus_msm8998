config QPNP_SMBCHARGER
	tristate "QPNP SMB Charger driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the dual path switch mode battery charger which
	  supports USB detection and battery charging up to 3A.
	  The driver also offers relevant information to userspace via the
	  power supply framework.

config QPNP_FG
	tristate "QPNP fuel gauge driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support for
	  battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to the
	  fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
	  supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.

config FG_BQ27541
	tristate "TI bq27541 fg"
	depends on I2C
	help
		Say Y here to enable the TI Fuel Gauge driver.

config ONEPLUS_FASTCHG
	tristate "ONEPLUS FAST CHARGE"
	depends on I2C
	help
		Say Y here to enable the ONEPLUS FAST CHARGE driver.

config QPNP_FG_GEN3
	tristate "QPNP GEN3 fuel gauge driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the GEN3 Fuel Gauge driver. This adds support
	  for battery fuel gauging and state of charge of battery connected to
	  the fuel gauge. The state of charge is reported through a BMS power
	  supply property and also sends uevents when the capacity is updated.

config SMB135X_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB135X Battery Charger"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB135X Battery Charger.
	  SMB135X is a dual path switching mode charger capable of charging
	  the battery with 3Amps of current.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config SMB1351_USB_CHARGER
	tristate "smb1351 usb charger (with VBUS detection)"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say Y to enable support for the SMB1351 switching mode based charger.
	 The driver supports charging control (enable/disable) and
	 charge-current limiting. It also provides USB VBUS detection and
	 notification support. The driver controls SMB1351 via I2C and
	 supports device-tree interface.

config MSM_BCL_CTL
	bool "BCL Framework driver"
	help
	  Say Y here to enable this BCL Framework driver. This driver provides
	  interface, which can be used by the BCL h/w drivers to implement the
	  basic functionalities. This framework abstracts the underlying
	  hardware for the top level modules.

config MSM_BCL_PERIPHERAL_CTL
	bool "BCL driver to control the PMIC BCL peripheral"
	depends on SPMI
	depends on MSM_BCL_CTL
	help
	  Say Y here to enable this BCL PMIC peripheral driver. This driver
	  provides routines to configure and monitor the BCL
	  PMIC peripheral.

config BATTERY_BCL
	tristate "Battery Current Limit driver"
	depends on THERMAL_MONITOR
	help
	  Say Y here to enable support for battery current limit
	  device. The BCL driver will poll BMS if
	  thermal daemon enables BCL.
	  It will notify thermal daemon if IBat crosses Imax threshold.

config QPNP_SMB2
	tristate "SMB2 Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Enables support for the SMB2 charging peripheral

config OP_DEBUG_CHG
	tristate "OP DEBUG CHARGE"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Enables support for the debug charging peripheral
	  When use agingboot,can dump pmic register and
	  print vbus vbat current information
	  a

config SMB138X_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB138X Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_I2C_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB138X Battery Charger.
	  SMB1380 is a dual phase 6A battery charger, and SMB1381 is a single
	  phase 5A battery charger.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.

config QPNP_QNOVO
	bool "QPNP QNOVO driver"
	depends on MFD_SPMI_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y here to enable the Qnovo pulse charging engine. Qnovo driver
	  accepts pulse parameters via sysfs entries and programs the hardware
	  module. It also allows userspace code to read diagnostics of voltage
	  and current measured during certain phases of the pulses.
